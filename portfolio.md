## The Mission
In a technology saturated world, we have an incredible opportunity and responsibility to develop tools that catalyze a fulfilling, meaningful life. Through the design choices we make, we create paths of least resistance that guide real people’s daily lives.
  
So, it’s important we choose carefully. The metrics that define corporate or user success have a substantive impact the human experience. Our work as developers isn’t just finding engineering, business, and aesthetic solutions, but to tackle problems steeped in psychological, sociological, and philosophical nuance.

When we forget the effects of our decisions, bad things happen. For example, when winning online means having more friends than your friends, we commodify the relationships that make life vital. When we optimize for “user attention,” we naturally undermine the self-restraint and agency of the people who chose to support us.
  
This constant fight to master your own attention is exhausting, and our friends and family on the other side of the screen have started to yearn for change.
  
I’m passionate about helping to meet the need for humane, ethical technology that empowers and enables people to live their lives more seamlessly with a confidence and strong sense of agency. I am excited to contribute to software at a moment where intentional design for time well spent, accessibility, and community has the power to set people free and open the world to experience in new, radical ways.
